# Advent of Code 2020

For the third time I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). After tapping out in 2018 after 9 days, I decided try to beat this score in 2019 - and I did, managing to solve the fist 13 days, included writing a fully functional intcode computer. Then my regular professional life won and prevented me from getting deeply involved into graph-related problems.

Now it's 2020. I barely touched coding this year and with my current schedule, I thought I wouldn't have time for this kind of fun and I probably don't. 

But I'm trying to solve some puzzles anyway!
