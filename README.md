# Advent of Code 2020

For the third time I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). After tapping out in 2018 after 9 days, I decided try to beat this score in 2019 - and I did, managing to solve the first 13 days, included writing a fully functional intcode computer. Then my regular professional life won and prevented me from getting deeply involved into graph-related problems.

Now it's 2020. I barely touched coding this year and with my current schedule, I thought I wouldn't have time for this kind of fun and I probably don't. 

But I'm trying to solve some puzzles anyway!

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2020:

* [Day 1](01/d01.py): Sum of Twos (**R**) and Sum of Threes (**L**)
* [Day 2](02/d02.py): Regular expressions (**R**)
* [Day 3](03/d03.py): Modulo operations (**R**) and reduce (**I**)
* [Day 4](04/d04.py): Regular expressions (**R**) and turtle animations (**L**)
* [Day 5](05/d05.py): Binary search (**R**)
* [Day 6](06/d06.py): Set operations (**I**)
* [Day 7](07/d07.py): Recursive DFS (**L**), iterative DFS (**R**), spotting directed graphs (**I**) and representing them as dicts-of-dicts (**L**)
* [Day 8](08/d08.py): Copying nested objects in Python (**R**)
* [Day 9](09/d09.py): Sum of Twos, again (**R**) and finding subarrays which sum to a number (**L**)
* [Day10](10/d10.py): ...that recursion is not always The Way [**R**]
